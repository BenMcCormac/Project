    and is specifically designed for an individual vehicle.A "burnished" finish to the exhause tip gives<br>
         the perfect look - of a high- performance vehivle that's been enjoyed to the fullest </p>

    <p> Only five master craftsmen in the world are allowed to hand-assemble this powerhouse engine. They are known as Takumi - a Japanese<br>
        term used to describe a master craftsman who has perfected his skills over years of painstaking work and dedication.<br></p>
    <p> The Nissan GT-R35 comes with a twin-turbocharged,<u><mark> 6-cylinder, 3.8-liter capacity, producing 480 horsepower when launched in 2007.</mark></u><br>
        But Nissan and the top tuners know that the dynamic block is capable of providing a much higher energy figure.<br> Nissan continues to 
        upgrade its engine to achive much higher power, which led them to creating the GT-R35 Nismo which has over <mark>600 Horsepower, </mark>until 2021

        <li><mark> 1 Carbon-Fiber hood </mark></li>
        <p1> Reducing weight over the nose of the vehicle lowers the overall center of gravity,<br>
        enchances front-to-rear weight distribution, and improves cornering turn-in.</p1>
        <li><mark> 2 Carbon-Fiber fenders with air outlets </mark></li>
        <p1>Carbon-fiber fenders reduce forward mass, allowing the GT-R NISMO o respond more quickly to steering input.<br>
        Aerodynamic vents come from the GT3 racing program <a href="https://www.nismo.co.jp/en/products/customerracing/racingcar.html" traget="_blank">(click here to know more about GT3 racing program)</a>
        , enchancing downforce.</p1>
        <li><mark> 3 Carbon-Fiber roof</mark></li>
        <p1> Reducing the weight of the roof brings the GT-R NISMO's center of mass lower, enchacing stability,<br>
        adding cornering grip and providing flatter cornering.</p1>
